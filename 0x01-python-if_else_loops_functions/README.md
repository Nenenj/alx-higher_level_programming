## Python - if/else, loops, functions
## Tasks:
0 This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

1 This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

2 Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

You can only use one print function with string format
You can only use one loop in your code
You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
You are not allowed to import any module

3 Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

4 Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)

5 Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
The last number should be followed by a new line
You can only use no more than 2 print functions with string format
You can only use one loop in your code
You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
You are not allowed to import any module

15 Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.

16 Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).

17 Write the Python function def magic calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
